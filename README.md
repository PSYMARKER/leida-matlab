## Installation of LEiDA Toolbox

Start by creating a new folder where all the LEiDA code and analyses will be saved.
Then to install the LEiDA Toolbox, simply unzip the folder downloaded from the [LEiDA Matlab Toolbox v1.0](https://github.com/PSYCHOMARK/leida-matlab/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.zip).

> Note that the LEiDA Toolbox requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Matlab Toolbox.

## LEiDA Start

The function ***LEiDA_Start.m*** runs the first stage of the LEiDA analyses. This function is divided into three sections. The user is expected to only need to change the inputs in *Section A*.

Input parameters:

- ***LEiDA_directory***: main directory of the LEiDA Toolbox; this should be a folder containing a folder (for example, designated LEiDA_Functions) which contains all the functions available in the toolbox;
- ***Data_directory***: directory of the folder with the parcellated fMRI data; this folder does not need to be inside the folder *LEiDA_directory*;
- ***run_name***: name of the current run to be used to create a folder to save the results from the LEiDA analyses;
- ***Conditions_tag***: tag of the conditions given in the imaging files; it is expected that the file names of the parcellated data files contain a tag stating the condition to which a given participant belongs to; the tags should correspond exactly to the tags used in the file names; there can be any number of conditions;
- ***Parcellation***: parcellation template applied to  segment the fMRI data. Available options include 'AAL116', 'AAL120', 'dbs80' and 'glasser360';
- ***N_areas***: number of brain areas of the parcellation to consider for analysis;
- ***TR***: TR of the fMRI data; if unknown use a TR of 1;
- ***Tmax***: number of TRs considering all fMRI sessions; if different scans have different number of TRs define Tmax as the maximum number of TRs observed across all participants;
- ***apply_filter***: apply temporal filtering to the parcellated data (0: no; 1: yes);
- ***flp***: lowpass frequency of filter (default 0.1);
- ***fhi***: highpass frequency of filter (default 0.01);
- ***Paired_tests***: experimental paradigm: 0 (unpaired) if subjects in different conditions are not the same; or 1 (paired) if subjects are the same across conditions;
- ***n_permutations***: number of permutations to be performed in hypothesis tests. For the first analysis to be relatively quick, run around 500 permutations, but then increase to 10000 to increase the reliability of the final statistical results (p-values) for publication.
- ***n_bootstraps***: number of bootstrap samples within each permutation. For the first analysis to be relatively quick, choose around 10, but then increase to 500 for more reliable final results.
- ***CortexDirection***: direction to plot the PL states/brain ('SideView' or 'TopView').

After filling the input parameters click *Run* on your Matlab dashboard.

Output:

- Creates a directory to store the results from the LEiDA analyses;
- Computes the leading eigenvectors of the data and saves them in the file *LEiDA_EigenVectors.mat*;
- Clusters the leading eigenvectors of all participants and saves the clusters in the file *LEiDA_Clusters.mat*;
- Computes the fractional occupancy, performs hypothesis (permutation) tests to compare the mean fractional occupancy across conditions and saves the results in the file *LEiDA_Stats_FracOccup.mat*;
- Plots figure with two-sided p-values obtained from the comparison of the mean fractional occupancy, plots figures with barplots of the fractional occupancy values and saves the figures in png and fig format;
- Computes the dwell time, performs hypothesis (permutation) tests to compare the mean dwell time across conditions and saves the results in the file *LEiDA_Stats_DwellTime.mat*;
- Plots figure with two-sided p-values obtained from the comparison of the mean dwell time, plots figures with barplots of the dwell time values and saves the figures in png and fig format;
- Plots the PL states (centroids) obtained by clustering the leading eigenvectors and saves the figure in png and fig format;

## Format of the inputs

The input data should be contained in the folder specified in the variable *Data_directory*. This folder should contain the time series data for each participant as a separate file. The file name of each participant should contain a tag specifying the condition of each participant to allow the computation of intergroup differences. The time series data can be supplied in the following formats:

- A (no. of brain areas $\times$ no. of time points) matrix with double or single precision numeric elements for each subject. The file can be either a Matlab file (.mat), a text file (.txt) or a .1D file. If the files are Matlab structure arrays, the time series fMRI data must be enclosed in a field named data.

## LEiDA Analysis K

The function ***LEiDA_AnalysisK.m*** plots a number of relevant figures to analyse the LEiDA results for a specific number of clusters. Based on the based on the outputs from the previous analyses (*LEiDA_Start.m*) the user should select one or more values for K to explore with greater detail.

- ***Parcellation***: parcellation template applied to the segment the fMRI data;

After filling the input parameters click *Run* on your Matlab dashboard.

Output:

- Plots several plots of the selected K:
    - PL states as links in cortex between the brain areas with positive values in the centroid vector;
    - PL states as nodes in cortex, where each brain area is coloured and scaled according to its value in the centroid vector;
    - PL states rendered in a 3D glass brain indicating the overlap with the functional brain networks defined by Yeo et al., (2011);
    - PL states in matrix format;
